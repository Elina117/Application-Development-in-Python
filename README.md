# Learning Python and API with Airflow ðŸš€

This repository contains materials and projects related to learning Python, developing APIs with FastAPI, and managing data workflows using Apache Airflow.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
In this project, I explored the fundamental concepts of programming in Python, creating APIs, and working with libraries such as FastAPI. I also familiarized myself with Apache Airflow for task management and workflow automation.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **AirFlow_Dag**: Educational materials for creating DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in Apache Airflow.
- **FastAPI_CK**: Examples of using FastAPI for handling requests (GET, POST) and dependency injection.
- **ORM_KC**: The first part of the final project dedicated to working with ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **Python**: Materials for learning the basics of Python and organizing folders in the project.
- **Play Store Data.csv**: Data for working with CSV files and the first part of the project.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - FastAPI: For creating APIs.
  - SQLAlchemy: For database operations via ORM.
  - Apache Airflow: For managing task workflows.
